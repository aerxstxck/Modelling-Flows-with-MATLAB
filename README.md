# Modelling-Flows-with-MATLAB
The repository contains MATLAB scripts for modeling ideal fluid flows using potential flow theory. It includes functions for source, sink, vortex, doublet, and uniform flow. These are combined to simulate complex flows, such as lifting flow over a cylinder, enabling visualization and analysis of fundamental aerodynamic phenomena.
